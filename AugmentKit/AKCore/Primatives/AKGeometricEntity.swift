/**
 An `AKGeometricEntity` represents a 3D geomentry existing in world space. It may be a rendered augmented object like a virtual sign or piece of furniture, or it may be a non-rendered reference geomentry that is used as meta information about the AR world like a 2D plane might represent a table top or a wall. The object's geometry is defiened by the `model` property and may contain animation therefore the geomentry it does not always have to represent a rigid body. AKGeometricEntity does not contain any position information so it does not mean anything by itself in the context of the AKWorld. It does serve as a base protocol for more meaningful Types like `AKAnchor` and `AKTracker`.
